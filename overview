I very much enjoyed the website building unit, and I think an intriguing final composition project that would aim to reach some asipirational goals would be to make another website that is a combination of a final portfolio and personal website.  In this website, I would include pages for each of my previous projects I have worked on this semester, along with their respective reflections, and the final composition reflection.  Then, if time allows, I would love to add other personal website aspects inspired by fellow students' personal websites, like my current favorite music album or things that have brought me inspiraiton in the last few months.  In this way, I hope to make my final project a stretch of what I have already learned in the web unit and add to my toolkit with the inclusion of multimedia, different formating and display techniques, and an easily editable and easy to add to with future work.
