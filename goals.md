<h1>Goals</h1>
Taking into consideration the baseline and aspiration criteria decided on in class on Thursday, below are some of the personal baseline and aspirational criteria I want to work towards for this final project portfolio:

<h2>Baseline Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>draw on design principles and digital affordances learned throughout the class to create a new personal website (differing from that of the web unit) to act as a personal blog/portfolio of work done this semester</li>
  <li>use only the resources I have fiar use to utilize (through creative commons, consent, fair use, etc) and credit all sources (taken from class baseline criteria)</li>
  <li>display each project from this semester in its own content page, located centrally in a "classwork" type of section on the website</li>
  <li>create a common color and font theme throughout the website</li>
  <li>keep my HTML and CSS code clean and organized so that the code reflects what is seen in the published webpage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>successfully implement the automatic slideshow of pictures in the website unit's website main page if time allows</li>
  <li>integrate new forms of digital media into my website through the personal blog section, like links to music recommendations or videos I enjoyed, etc. that I did not incorporate into the web unit's webpage</li>
  <li>use new-for-me tools and code in creating my website (for example, using a different layout format)</li>
  <li>Achieve as many of my goals as possible within the limited timeframe (taken from class aspirational goals</li>
  <li>Demonstrate growth as a digital composer/designer over the course of the semester in my final product and in my ability to articulate the design decisions involved (taken from class aspirational goals)</li>
